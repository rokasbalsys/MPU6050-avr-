# MPU6050-avr-
MPU6050 for Atmel Studio 6.2

This is my first repository on GitHub but I noticed that it's hard to find working MPU6050 library. I made it work. So I am posting it. Using USAR library, change it with ur own, because it can not work for you. You must use MPU interrupt pin. Not this library is made for Atmega328P and using (D3) pin on arduino or INT1 pin for atmega328P. If you use ur own interrupt change it in library.
